# Interview HTML CSS Javascript Test

## Description
I wanted to buld an HTML questionnaire that would allow me to practice using Javascript to dynamically modify a webpage. I just started learning javascript and this project let me take my knowledge and expand it to be functional beyond basics. This webpage allows the user to test their knowledge of some of the more basic HTML concepts but does have a couple advanced ideas in there. This would be a good place to practice your knowledge of HTML before an exam or interview. Even though my main focus was javascript practice building the site really required me to learn more about HTML. Putting elements together in ways I had not done before required me to do a lot of research into why interactions where happening that I didnt expect and figure out ways to solve them. An example was trying to put a radio button on a list item. List items are display:list-item which does display:block but also adds the list element on the outside. Sadly a lot of that work was not used in the final product but it did help me understand things that I will probably use in the future.
